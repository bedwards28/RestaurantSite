                        <p>
                            We use always fresh, never frozen premium chicken 
                            breast tenderloins to make the most tender ckicken 
                            fingers possible. Every piece is hand-dipped and 
                            breaded fresh for every order.

                        <p>
                            Our steak cut fries are center-cut from grade A 
                            potatoes. They are cooked to a golden brown while 
                            remaining slightly soft in the middle. They are 
                            cooked to order in our premium Canola Oil blend 
                            and lightly seasoned immediately after leaving 
                            the frier. They go great with Kicken' Sauce, 
                            ketchup, or just by themselves!

                            Our garlic bread is cooked to order from sesame 
                            seeded pull-apart bread, which preserves freshness 
                            better than pre-sliced bread. Each piece is brushed 
                            with the perfect amount of butter and garlic before 
                            grilling on a flat top surface to create its toasty
