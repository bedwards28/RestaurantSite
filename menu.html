                            Our steak cut fries are center-cut from grade A 
                            potatoes. They are cooked to a golden brown while 
                            remaining slightly soft in the middle. They are 
                            cooked to order in our premium Canola Oil blend 
                            and lightly seasoned immediately after leaving 
                            the frier. They go great with Kicken' Sauce, 
                            ketchup, or just by themselves!
